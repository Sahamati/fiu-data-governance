# Confidential Clean Room (CCR) Services for DEPA

Confidential clean rooms (CCRs) are a new privacy construct in DEPA which enforce that data is only
used in accordance with the data principal's consent.

This repository contains guidelines for enabling data processing services to be hosted in confidential clean room environments, as well as a reference implementation 
of CCRs (provided **As-Is** as **beta**) for the AA ecosystem.

We actively welcome contributions and feedback from the community.
